Measure theory classes often require students to know certain fundamental results and tricks from real analysis, set theory, and more, but students (including myself when I took the course) are not always aware of these results.  Either they learned them a long time ago and have forgotten to keep them handy in their toolkit, or they never learned them before and are not aware the results exist.  Therefore, I created these notes to help students be aware of these results.  If you have suggestions or additions, please feel free to open an issue!  I would love for this to be a community resource.
